# Music Player Application - User Manual & Technical Documentation

**Submitted to:** Unified Mentor
**Project Title:** Music Player
**Difficulty Level:** Hard

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a modern, web-based music player designed to provide a seamless listening experience. It goes beyond basic playback by integrating professional features such as a real-time frequency visualizer, custom playlist management, and a persistent library system. The application is built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, ensuring a responsive design that works across various screen sizes.

## 2. User Guide

### **Importing Music**
1. Click the **"Import Song"** button (located in the bottom-right of the player bar or the empty state screen).
2. Select an audio file (MP3, WAV, etc.) from your device.
3. The song will be immediately added to the **"Local Files"** playlist in your library without interrupting your current playback.

### **Playback Controls**
- **Play/Pause:** Toggle playback using the center button.
- **Seek:** Click anywhere on the progress bar to jump to a specific timestamp.
- **Volume:** Use the slider on the right side of the player bar to adjust volume. Click the speaker icon to Mute/Unmute.
- **Shuffle:** Click the Shuffle icon (intertwined arrows) to randomize the queue.
- **Repeat:** Click the Repeat icon to cycle modes:
  - *No Repeat* (Gray)
  - *Repeat All* (Cyan)
  - *Repeat One* (Cyan with "1" badge)

### **Managing Playlists**
1. Click **"New Playlist"** in the top header.
2. Enter a name for your playlist.
3. To add a song, hover over any track in the "Discover" or "Local Files" list and click the **+ (Plus)** button.
4. Select the destination playlist from the prompt.

## 3. Technical Architecture

### **Audio Controller (The Engine)**
The application uses a **Singleton Design Pattern** for the `AudioController`. This ensures there is only one instance of the `HTMLAudioElement` and `AudioContext` active at any time, preventing memory leaks and overlapping audio.
- **Web Audio API:** Used to extract frequency data for the visualizer.
- **Media Session API:** Integrates with the operating system's media controls (allowing keyboard media keys to work).

### **State Management (The Brain)**
We utilize **Zustand** for global state management. This handles:
- **Queue Logic:** Managing the list of songs to play next.
- **Persistence:** Automatically saving your playlists and volume preferences to the browser's LocalStorage, so you don't lose your data on refresh.

### **Visualizer**
The visualizer renders a real-time frequency graph using the HTML5 `<canvas>` element. It connects to the `AnalyserNode` in the `AudioController` to sync the animation frame rate with the audio data.
